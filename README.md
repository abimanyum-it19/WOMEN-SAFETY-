# WOMEN-SAFETY-
Designed software for women Safety

Providing Safety for women in the nighttime by Artificial Intelligences techniques. The cameras will be able to detect any change in the facial expressions of a woman being subjected to stalking, threats, or harassment on the streets, and an alert will be sent to the police control room.

# NEED FOR PROJECT
1.The society probably living in the worst time. Our current society has ever seen in terms of women security. The projects aim is to make women experience as strong as ever and sufficiently able to fight the parasites of our general public. Our project is an idea that makes every place safer for women.

2.Nowadays the news about women harassment is more than their accomplishments. The purpose of the proposed system is to decrease the incidence of sexual harassment faced by women experiences in their life and to increase women self-confidence to step out to their office during nights and desire to use public spaces in the city particularly during night.

3.Women feel unsafe to move alone at bizarre times. There are many applications that are built for women safety. Even there are many uneducated women those who do not have android phones or do not know how to handle it. The proposed system aims to provide safety for the women who are in trouble. Surely there will be CCTV cameras in every public place.

4.This model does not require any special hardware and it uses algorithm for the precaution of women. The algorithm is then applied on the CCTV cameras and then the gender of the person will be predicted. The Warning message will be sent to the close by police head quatres; This project is made for the conveniences of all women.

# IMPLEMENTATION METHODOLOGY
Even though there are specialized apps and many IOT devices for women safety, this proposed system doesnâ€™t require any special computer hardware to process. Since, it is user friendly and will be supportive for the uneducated and poor people. The preprocessed CCTV footage are applied to Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and tensor flow for classification.

Implementation Methodology is classified into three modules.

 A) Human Detection 
 
 B) Gender Prediction
 
 C) Anomalous Activity Detection 
 
 # WORK FLOW
Step 1: Access Live CCTV camera stream.

Step 2: detects the Presence of humans

Step 3: If any human activity is detected it will enter the next module (i.e.) Gender prediction.

Step 4: It will be identifying any women is there or not.

Step 5: Then it will be looking for anomalous activity.

Step 6: If any activity is found it will be sending an alert notification to the close by police station or control room.
